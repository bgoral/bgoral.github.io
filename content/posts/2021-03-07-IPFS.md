## Web 3.0
There is a lot of buzz about Web 3.0 out there and Its not new. When people got used to the term Web 2.0, academics and experts had started publishing their articles on this extremely compelling subject. Marketing and sales teams were already polishing the term. The oldest article that I can find is from 2005 with the title "[What to expect from Web 3.0][1]".

If I look at the year 2005, the world was different. We were like most of the world, trying to build for the Web. Shifting our mind, businesses and customers. Everything was getting more independent -or look like-, more accessible and information there for you to pick up. And programing languages, tools were getting there.

I think everything in that article has already been achieved and on top of that foundations of (I want to call) Web x.0 has been laid.

## What is this buzz about?
I believe there are 2 different noise out there. 

- One is played by big tech companies by innovating AI and accelerating the speed of automation ([Google in Trouble][2]). Trying to get rid of the dependency on people to run their businesses, instead, want to use people and milk their data with an imaginary [Perpetual Motion][3]. On the other hand, expecting governments or organizations to invent new jobs for these people on big tech infrastructure. I mean jobs like "Influencer", "SEO Optimizer", "XX Cloud Architect", "XXX AI Expert".

- The other buzz is about distribution and sharing by disrupting and innovating money, governance, infrastructure, privacy, data, probably everything we know provided by big tech and governments. The tech is open. It is like season 2 of the GNU movement. Read the documents of this tech its like reading Neuromancer;

## What does it look like

There are many projects out there. Some of them you already [know][4]. But I am not going to write about cryptocurrencies but cryptocurrencies are part of this Web x.0 infrastructure.
Although due to the investors, I am a little bit distant to [Polkadot][5], the most complete representation of this  Web x.0 is from their [foundation site][6]

And you can build any layer where there are huge opportunities. 

## InterPlanetary Filesystem

Since last year I am following up closely on the IPFS project. Which is less sci-fi but;

> “Don't let the little fuckers generation gap you.” William Gibson, Neuromancer

If you are familiar with p2p network concepts, the first part of the documentation will be less compelling. But when you start to read concepts like "[Merkle Distributed Acyclic Graphs][7]" prepare yourself for confusion and luckily there are [bananas][8] there for people like me.

### Main Components of IPFS

There are three fundamental principles to understanding IPFS:

- Unique identification via content addressing: Every piece of content that uses the IPFS protocol has a content identifier, or CID and IPLD.

- Content linking via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): IPFS uses a Merkle DAG that is optimized for representing directories and files. To build a Merkle DAG representation of your content, IPFS often first splits it into blocks. Splitting it into blocks means that different parts of the file can come from different sources and be authenticated quickly.
- Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs): To find which peers are hosting the content you're after (discovery), IPFS uses a distributed hash table or DHT. A hash table is a database of keys to values. A distributed hash table is one where the table is split across all the peers in a distributed network. To find content, you ask these peers.

As IPFS is providing high throughput, low latency, data distribution, its already ready for Web x.0 applications. For 3 weeks, I am working on one.

The whole thing is a beautiful, refreshing piece of tech. Philosophically, I support. Who will win? I am not that optimistic about the controllability of big tech. But that is clear: IPFS, distributed web and decentralization will survive Covid-19 and disrupt the future.
