      <description>In 2013, I was working as a technical lead for the company website transformation project for an electric distribution company. The technology was preselected by the upper management (SharePoint) and the contract was already signed. I was going to assure the quality of delivery. The old website was also SharePoint and it was too expensive to scale and maintain. Of course, I am not going to mention about the cost of license, development and infrastructure of this new website but this was (probably today in many organizations) the situation more or less 10 years ago.</description>
