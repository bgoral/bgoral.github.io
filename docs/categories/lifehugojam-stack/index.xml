      <description>In 2013, I was working as a technical lead for the company website transformation project. The technology was preselected by the vendor and upper management (SharePoint) and the contract was already signed. I was going to assure the quality of delivery. The old website was also SharePoint and it was too expensive to scale and maintain. Of course, I am not going to mention about the cost of licence, development and infrastructure of this new website but this was (probably today in many organisations) the situation more or less 10 years ago.</description>
