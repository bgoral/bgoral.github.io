      <description>HeavyPass I think the future of authentication will be passwordless. We are very close to that future but not there yet. Still, most of the applications require username and passwords, but enhancing with additional validation methods (Multi Factor Authentication) like SMS, Authenticator Apps, Biometric scanning etc. In addition to that, users are being forced to change their passwords after some time and mostly not allowed to use one of the last 3 passwords.</description>
