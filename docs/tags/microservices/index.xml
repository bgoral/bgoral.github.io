      <description>What is Dapr?  Dapr is a portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for any developer to build resilient, stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embraces the diversity of languages and developer frameworks.
 For me, this statement is definition of a remarkable modern solution to many complexities so I wanted to try and built a geocoding service using libpostal integrated to dapr sidecar.</description>

      <description>In the reactive manifesto resilient systems described as:
 Resilient: The system stays responsive in the face of failure. This applies not only to highly-available, mission-critical systems â€” any system that is not resilient will be unresponsive after a failure. Link
 Although there is a kind of philosophical manifesto available written/signed by builders, I believe, the expectation from the writers of this manifesto was always to build resilient things under chaos, uncertainty and continuous change.</description>
