      <description>Power of Value Product-oriented companies exist and grow by generating value to their customers and they are especially good at prioritizing what to ship and where to invest their energy. They collect sufficient enough information to build, measure and learn to pivot their backlog of ideas or requirements.
But one can not observe this in government investments or most of the large enterprise companies. For most of the cases in my country for example; government decisions made to achieve political goals or maintain the status quo, instead of generating more value to increase the overall prosperity of citizens.</description>

      <description>In 2013, I was working as a technical lead for the company website transformation project for an electric distribution company. The technology was preselected by the upper management (SharePoint) and the contract was already signed. I was going to assure the quality of delivery. The old website was also SharePoint and it was too expensive to scale and maintain. Of course, I am not going to mention about the cost of license, development and infrastructure of this new website but this was (probably today in many organizations) the situation more or less 10 years ago.</description>

      <description>I restarted this blog to go back, remind and remember the fundamentals that brought me here. Fundamentals are the compass that keeps mind and reality together. Joel Goldberg, 45 years experienced software engineering veteran wrote a great article about basics. I put here to remind and remember.
 Focus on the Fundamentals Technology constantly changes, but some fundamental approaches to software development transcend these trends. Here are six fundamentals that will continue to be relevant for a long time.</description>
